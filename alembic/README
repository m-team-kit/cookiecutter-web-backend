Generic single-database configuration.

The database connection is configured by the environment variables:

```bash
POSTGRES_HOST
POSTGRES_USER
POSTGRES_PASSWORD
POSTGRES_DB
```

## Generate a migrations

In case you have modified the models and need to create a new migration, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Migration message"
```

This will create a new migration file in the `alembic/versions` folder.
You should review the migration file and modify it if necessary.
Once you test the migration, remember to commit this file to the repository and run the migrations in the production environment.

> Or use the vscode command `Python: Alembic revision`.

## Upgrade database

Before you can run the application, you need to create the database and run the migrations. You can do this with the following commands:

```bash
$ alembic upgrade head
```

Remember this should be run in the production database so the changes are applied.

> Or use the vscode command `Python: Alembic upgrade`.
